# Mimo-VL- Batch
This tool utilizes [XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-VL](https://github.com/XiaomiMiMo/MiMo-VL) to caption image files in a batch.

Place all images you wish to caption in the /input directory and run `py batch.py`.

It's a very fast and fairly robust captioning model that has a high level of intelligence and really listens to the user's input prompt!

## Requirements
* Python 3.11.
  * It's been tested with 3.11
  * It may work with other versions

* Cuda 12.4.
  * It may work with other versions
 
* PyTorch
  * 2.7.0.dev20250310+cu124
  * 0.22.0.dev20250226+cu124
  * Make sure it works with Cuda 12.4 and it should be fine
 
* GPU with ~17.5gb VRAM

## Setup
_Remember to install pytorch before requirements!_

1. Create a virtual environment. Use the included `venv_create.bat` to automatically create it.
2. Install Pytorch: `pip install --force-reinstall torch torchvision --pre --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu124 --no-deps`
3. Install the libraries in requirements.txt. `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This is done by step 1 when asked if you use `venv_create`.
4. Install [Pytorch for your version of CUDA](https://pytorch.org/).
5. Open `batch.py` in a text editor and edit any settings you want.

## How to use
1. Activate the virtual environment. If you installed with `venv_create.bat`, you can run `venv_activate.bat`.
2. Run `python batch.py` from the virtual environment.

This runs captioning on all images in the /input/-folder.

## Configuration
You may want to open up `batch.py` and edit the configuration options at the top of the script.

Most of these settings are also available as input arguments.

```
# Generic options
PRINT_CAPTIONS = True           # Print generated captions to console
PRINT_CAPTIONING_STATUS = False # Print status messages for caption saving
OVERWRITE = True                # Overwrite existing caption files
PREPEND_STRING = ""             # String to prepend to captions
APPEND_STRING = ""              # String to append to captions
STRIP_LINEBREAKS = True         # Remove line breaks from captions
DEFAULT_SAVE_FORMAT = ".txt"    # Default file extension for caption files

# MiMo options
INCLUDE_THINKING = False        # Include <think> tag content in output
OUTPUT_JSON = False             # Save captions as JSON instead of plain text
REMOVE_CHINESE = True           # Remove Chinese characters from captions
NORMALIZE_TEXT = True           # Normalize punctuation and remove Markdown

# Image resizing options
MAX_WIDTH = 1024                # Maximum width for resized images
MAX_HEIGHT = 1024               # Maximum height for resized images

# Generation parameters
REPETITION_PENALTY = 1.2        # Penalty for repeated tokens
TEMPERATURE = 0.8               # Sampling temperature
TOP_K = 50                      # Top-k sampling parameter
```

## Example prompts
You can edit `batch.py` in a text editor and edit the DEFAULT_PROMPT value to change the captioning prompt.

### Extreme Detailed caption
Describe this image in vivid detail. Go into detail and caption every single part of it. Do not miss out on small but important detail or background description. Focus on the main subjects of the image first, do not use lists or headers
> Central Figure: Anthropomorphic Rabbit - Humanoid Hybrid 1. Head & Facial Features - The creature has a rabbit - faced torso merged with a human - shaped upper body. Its face is pure bunny: large, upright ears (architectural marvels!) covered in golden, wing - like armor plating with veiny, translucent edges (reminiscent of butterfly wings). These \"ears\" curve upward, culminating in pointed tips studded with tiny gem accents. - Eyes: Large, luminous pale blue irises sit within round, expressive sockets, bordered by fine black lashes. Above them, subtle eyeliner - like markings add drama. - Nose: Small, rounded, pinkish - beige, resembling a real rabbit's snout, with two faint white whisker hairs curling near the cheeks. 2. Armor & Attire (Fantasy Medieval Fusion) - Chest Plate: Dominant turquoise (teal) metal, sculpted to fit the feminine torso. Embedded with deep - blue sapphire - sized jewels and smaller red gems along ornate gold filigree borders. Intricate etchings (scrollwork, floral motifs) cover the gold trim, showcasing hyper - realistic metallurgy. - Shoulder Pauldrons: Angular, overlapping shields extending from the shoulders, mirroring the turquoise base with gold edging and embedded blue/red gems. They flare slightly, evoking both protection and grandeur. - Arm Gauntlets: Sleeveless, baring pale, creamy skin. Gold - plated bands wrap around forearms, ending in claw - like finger guards (delicately curved, not menacing). Each glove holds a slender, wand - like accessory attached to the forearm: a twisted gold rod topped with a floating blue crystal sphere (glowing softly), hinting at magic. - Waist & Hip Accents: Layered turquoise panels meet thigh - high skirts made of semi - transparent, feather - like material (light teal, edged with gold frills). Gem clusters anchor these layers to the armor. - Greaves (Lower Leg Armor): Gold - trimmed turquoise bracers covering calves, connected to knee - high boots. The boots blend leather - like texture (textured stitching visible) with gold buckles and straps, finishing in gold toe caps (bare toes otherwise, enhancing elegance). 3. Posture & Silhouette Standing tall, balanced, with hands relaxed at sides-one gloved fingers lightly grip the crystalline wand - accessory. The posture exudes confidence, royal bearing, yet approachable kindness (due to the bunny facial structure). ### Background: Enchanted Forest Clearing 4. Foreground & Framing Elements - Trees: Twin ancient oak - like trunks flank the figure, framing it like a portrait. Bark is deeply grooved, knotted, and earthy brown (moss - speckled patches). Smaller branches arch overhead, sparse leaves dappling light. - Ground Cover: Lush, emerald - green moss blankets the soil, interspersed with tiny ferns and clover. Textures vary-from velvety to slightly rough-suggesting damp, fertile terrain. Faint dew droplets glisten where light hits. 5. Midground & Distant Environment Beyond the trees, a misty forest canopy looms: dark teal foliage blurs into shadow, implying depth. Subtle hints of fireflies or bioluminescent fungi dot the background, casting faint warm glows. The color palette shifts to deeper blues and greens, contrasting sharply with the foreground's brightness to emphasize the central figure. 6. Atmosphere & Lighting - Light Source(s): Primary illumination comes from above/behind, rim - lighting the rabbit - warrior's silhouette so it floats against the darker backdrop. Warmer highlights catch metallic armor and fur, while cooler shadows deepen the forest depths. - Mood: Ethereal, dreamlike-a realm between reality and fantasy. Mist, dappled light, and biotic elements (crystals, enchanted flora) reinforce a sense of magic woven into nature. 7. Artistic Style & Details Hyper - detailed digital painting. Every surface shows textural precision: - Metal: Reflective highlights on armor, scratches/stains for wear. - Fur/Skin: Smooth gradients on exposed limbs, slight translucency at joints. - Nature: Individual moss blades, curled fern fronds, tree bark cracks-all rendered with botanical accuracy. In sum, the image balances whimsy (bunny anatomy, fairy - tale magic) with grandeur (ornate armor, cinematic lighting), placing a noble, enchanted being at the heart of an otherworldly forest sanctuary. No detail is overlooked-the fusion of beast, beauty, and blade feels intentional, crafting a legend - worthy protagonist.
